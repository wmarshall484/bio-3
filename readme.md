Final project for bioinformatics:

Compile the project by typing make. 

The program it created will build either a UPGMA tree or a
NeighborJoining tree depending on the parameters with which you run
the program.

./main 0 inputGrid.grid

will make a UPGMA tree from the file inputGrid.grid

./main 1 inputGrid.grid

will make a NeigborJoining tree from the file inputGrid.grid
